### Project Overview
"Y" is a MERN stack application that provides a Twitter-like platform for users to post short messages (tweets), follow other users, and interact with their feed. Users can create accounts, post tweets, follow and be followed by other users, and explore their feed. The application is built using the following technologies:

- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js
- **Redux**: For state management
- **Socket.io**: For real-time notifications

### Features
- User Registration and Authentication
- Posting and Editing Tweets
- Following and Followers System
- Real-time Notifications
- Profile Customization
- Tweet Likes and Comments
- Explore and Interact with a Personalized Feed

## 2. Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
Before getting started, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB (local or remote)
- Git

### Setting Up MongoDB
You need a MongoDB instance for the application to store data. You can install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. Configure your MongoDB connection in the application's configuration file (see Step 3).

## 3. Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd y-mern-twitter
   ```

2. Install the server dependencies:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the client dependencies:
   ```

   npm install
   ```

### Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory and configure it with the following environment variables:
   - `PORT` (Server port)
   - `MONGO_URI` (MongoDB connection URI)
   - `JWT_SECRET` (A secret key for JWT token)
   - `JWT_EXPIRATION` (Token expiration time)

2. Create a `.env` file in the `/client` directory and set the environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` to your server's API URL.

### Running the Application
1. Start the server (from the `/server` directory):
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the client (from the `/client` directory):
